## Key Features
- **Wavelet-Guided Backbone**: Expands receptive fields by 8Ã— through Daubechies wavelet decomposition, achieving **77.4% AP50** on industrial defect detection.
- **Sparse Spatial Encoder (SSE)**: Reduces attention computation by 60% via 3D adaptive sampling while maintaining accuracy.
- **Real-Time Efficiency**: 114 FPS on NVIDIA T4 GPU with 44.3M parameters (21% faster than RT-DETR).
- **Robust Industrial Adaptation**: State-of-the-art performance on HQAD (63.1% AP5095), MPID (72.6% AP5095), and RD (78.2% AP5095) benchmarks.
